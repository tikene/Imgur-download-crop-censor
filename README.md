When you specify an Imgur link, it will be automatically downloaded and images are cropped according to the dimensions you specify (height/width).
This is useful because it allows users to post these images in social media where there's only a few accepted dimensions, such as Instagram or Twitter.
It can also detect any slurs using ProfanityFilter module and censor them using a random image from the "Censor Images" folder.
